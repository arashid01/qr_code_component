## Overview

The goal of this challenge was to build a simple and visually appealing QR code card component. It required clean, semantic HTML and well-structured, responsive CSS. The project is beginner-friendly and focuses on mastering layout techniques like Flexbox and improving design consistency with reusable styles. The final design mimics a real-world component that could be used in a landing page or a digital product.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge helped me reinforce the basics of HTML and CSS. I practiced:

- Structuring HTML semantically.
- Using Flexbox to center content vertically and horizontally.
- Applying responsive design principles using media queries.
- Utilizing Google Fonts for improved typography.
- Creating a visually appealing card component with shadows, borders, and rounded corners.

Here's a snippet I'm proud of that handles responsiveness nicely:

```css
@media (min-width: 376px) {
	.container {
		width: 375px;
	}

	#firstLine {
		font-size: 1.2rem;
	}

	#secondLine {
		font-size: 0.9rem;
	}
}
